# Bamazon-Store-Entry-Ecommerce-Website-

This is a fictional Marketplace that I'm currently working on. I'm using the YouTube channel @DailyTuition's tutorial for a base, and I     will be branching away from the tutorial after it's finish to develop additional features and polish the UI. This is my very first         website and I plan to use this to further develop skills as a Full Stack Developer.
The site in it's entirety, when finished by the tutorial, uses the following languages -  
- Html 
- CSS 
- JS 
- Bootstrap

More will be added in the future. this is one of many of the open projects I plan on keeping open for anyone to view and suggest as        they please. Keep in mind I'm not a professional! I am training myself to become a Software Developer with no Degree, but I do have        college experience in Digital Media Design. With that being said, what I plan to accomplish with this project is to test my skills on the fron-end side of things. Some features that I may add in the future after it's "done", may be a more in-depth shopping cart system, back-end technologies like Python for databases and other Dev-op features. all a work in progress as of 10/30/2019.
